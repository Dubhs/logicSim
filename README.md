# Logic Sim
I started this while bored over a few days i was off work for christmas, i have always been obsessed with logic gates and
at the time i was digging into some swift to try my hand at ios app dev, this was a fun little project to simulate linking
logic gates together via the command line and running binary thru the chain, its not complete on the frontend side and probably
needs a better command system but its a fun little game to mess with logic in software!
